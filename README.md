# How Does Gender Balance In Training Data Affect Face Recognition Accuracy?
This repository contains all 42 trained models from the paper [How Does Gender Balance In Training Data Affect Face Recognition Accuracy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02934).
The trained models vary in loss function, training dataset, and gender ratio.
It also contains the name of the images used to create the subset from the FRGC dataset.

Models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BUpPkiUhnZ-tbfhd304Ttb-IFYTA_u3n?usp=sharing).

The cleaned Public-IvS that is used in the paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qSwX7hDmww-A2Zwo5EUP9nZaOpc3RLJw).

To extract features using the model provided, use [insightface_feature_extraction](https://github.com/vitoralbiero/face_matching/blob/master/insightface_feature_extraction.py).

And to match features, use [mult_feature_match_list](https://github.com/vitoralbiero/face_matching/blob/master/mult_feature_match_list.py).

You will need a copy of the InsighFace [deploy folder](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/deploy).

If you use our model, please cite the paper below.

If you use any of the models or the FRGC subset please cite the paper below.
